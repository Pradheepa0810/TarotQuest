# Tarot Quest

Tarot Quest is a single-page, front-end web app for learning tarot cards one card at a time through guided lessons, quizzes, achievements, and progression tracking.

## How To Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` (or `tarot-quest.html`) in any modern browser.
3. Start from the Home scene and use the in-app buttons to navigate.

No build step or backend server is required.

## Publish With GitHub Pages

This is a static front-end app: it uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and local assets, with no server-side code or build step. `index.html` is the GitHub Pages entry point and forwards visitors to the app in `tarot-quest.html`.

To publish it:

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. Open the repository's **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
4. Select branch **main** and folder **/(root)**, then click **Save**.
5. Wait for the Pages deployment to finish. The site will be available at `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/TarotQuest/`.

The app's styles, scripts, and images use relative paths, so they work from the repository's project-site URL. Progress is stored in each visitor's browser with `localStorage`; it is not shared between devices or users. Google Fonts, Lucide icons, and one tarot image are loaded from external hosts, so those resources require an internet connection.

## What Each File Does

### Root Files

- `tarot-quest.html`: Main HTML shell. Mount point and script/style includes for the app.
- `deck-data.js`: Tarot deck source data (cards, ordering, and metadata consumed by app logic).
- `README.md`: Project documentation and usage notes.

### Styles

- `assets/css/main.css`: All visual styling, layout, transitions, animation timings, and component state classes.

### Core App Scripts

- `assets/js/app.js`: Main runtime controller. Handles state transitions, rendering orchestration, navigation logic, progression, gems, and action wiring.
- `assets/js/intro-sequence.js`: Intro behavior handler. Legacy full-screen intro is programmatically disabled and hidden to prevent interaction conflicts.

### Service/Logic Modules

- `assets/js/modules/state-manager.js`: Creates and resets canonical application state (progress, settings, current view, review/session info).
- `assets/js/modules/storage-service.js`: Browser `localStorage` JSON read/write utility used for persistence.
- `assets/js/modules/quiz-engine.js`: Quiz correctness evaluation and completion checks.
- `assets/js/modules/achievement-service.js`: Achievement progress tracking, unlock checks, group completion logic, and gem rewards.

### Renderer Modules

- `assets/js/modules/renderers/home-renderer.js`: Home panel markup, cottage-to-letter transition visuals, and Home CTA buttons.
- `assets/js/modules/renderers/quiz-renderer.js`: Quiz screen markup, answer selection UI, and submit button state.
- `assets/js/modules/renderers/results-renderer.js`: Seeker Accuracy screen, question result breakdown, earned gems, and post-quiz actions.
- `assets/js/modules/renderers/library-renderer.js`: Alchemy Library achievement card grid and achievement visuals.
- `assets/js/modules/renderers/chest-renderer.js`: Treasure Room panel, gem visuals, progression summary, and gem interaction effects.

### Images

- `assets/images/`: Artwork and UI imagery used across Home, transition scenes, Treasure Room, and achievement cards.

## Maintenance Notes

- Keep tarot card content updates in `deck-data.js`.
- Keep UX/visual tweaks in `assets/css/main.css`.
- Keep behavior/state/routing changes in `assets/js/app.js` and `assets/js/modules/*`.
- Use renderer modules for markup changes to specific pages instead of editing unrelated app logic.
